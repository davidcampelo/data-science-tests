# Data science studies

In this repository I aim to share all my studies on data science using Python. Initially, a notebook has a bunch of code used to clean and ajust data downloaded from a set of different free world socio demographic databases. Data on GPD per capita, population and life expectancy is used to demonstrate some Python Numpy and Matplotlib functions. Finally, using the Quandl module we test some Pandas funcionalities to analyse the housing prices and mortgage rates in the past 40 years of United States.
