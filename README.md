# Data science with Python

In this repository I aim to share all my studies on data science using Python. Initially, a notebook has a bunch of code used to clean and ajust data downloaded from a set of different free world sociodemographic databases. Then, some other notebooks intend to show some basic operations of pandas, numpy and matplotlib modules. These module are used to plot graphs and analyse data regarding world's GPD per capita, population and life expectancy. In addition, I use Quandl module and Google's finance API to test some Pandas funcionalities and analyse the housing prices and mortgage rates in the past 40 years of United States. Some tests with basemap module and 3D graphs are also available.
